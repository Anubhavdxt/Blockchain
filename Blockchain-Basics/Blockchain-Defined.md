# Blockchain Defined: Bitcoin

- Unlike traditional methods, blockchain enables **P2P** (peer to peer) transfer of digital assets without any intermediaries.
- It was a technology originally created to support the famous cryptocurrency, BitCoin.
- The blockchain permeated a broad range of applications across finance, healthcare, government, manufacturing, and distribution.

## The applications of blockchain

- Goods transfer,for example, supply chain.
- Digital media transfer,for example, sale of art. Remote services delivery,example, travel and tourism.
- Platform for decentralized business logic,for example, moving computing to data sources.
- Distributed intelligence,example, education credentialing.
- Distributed resources, for example, power generation and distribution.
- Crowd funding for example,startup fund raising.
- Crowd operations, for example, electronic voting.
- Identity management, for example, one ID for all your life's functions.
- And government public records and open governing.
- Blockchain can enable an inclusive economy.
- It can enable a person in a remote corner of the world to partake in a democratic process.

## Two major contributions of cryptocurrency Bitcoin

- A continuously working digital currency system
- A model for autonomous decentralized application technology called the blockchain

Around 2008, 2009, when the institutions and markets we trusted went crumbling down, and everybody was running away from the Wall Street, a mysterious person, or persons, called **Satoshi Nakamoto**, introduced a new digital currency, a cryptocurrency called Bitcoin.

Bitcoin enabled an innovative platform for peer to peer transfer of value without any central authority.
By implementing software programs for validation, verification, consensus in a novel infrastructure called the blockchain.
Later on in about 2012, 2013, computation elements were added to the blockchain infrastructure that has opened up a whole world of possibilities beyond simple currency transfer.

Blockchain is about enabling peer to peer transaction in a decentralized network. Establishing trust among unknown peers. Recording the transaction in an immutable distributed ledger.

## Example

In a **Centralized system** scenario where customer wants to buy an item using the credit card intermediaries involved are:

1. Credit card agency
2. Customer bank
3. Credit cards bank
4. An exchange
5. The merchant's bank
6. The merchant.

But in a **Decentralized system** peers can transact directly with each other irrespective of where they are located. Functions of the intermediaries are shifted to the periphery to the peer participant in the blockchain infrastructure. Peers are not necessarily known to each other.

## Establishing trust

- Validation & Verification: Validate, verify, and confirm transactions.
- Immutable recording: Record the transaction in a distributed ledger of blocks. Create a tamper-proof record of blocks, chain of blocks.
- Consensus: Implement a consensus protocol for agreement on the block to be added to the chain.
- Summarizing, blockchain technology supports methods for a decentralized peer-to-peer system, a collective trust model, and a distributed immutable ledger of records of transactions.
